This is the repo where we will commit our individual CSS/HTML pages. To choose what pages you want to
work on, use the google sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EWuSO3hb8DuNB266G_IPC64w3RBLd3IGWlyNucOLwEk/edit?usp=sharing).

To see what the pages should look like, use our first assignment as refference. You can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppfm_JvPCQwaqxGqWvwBQqfLoIjiocE6RQyy6_LTxCE/edit?usp=sharing). If Kenia could upload the rendersto the repo itself, that would be helpful too =)

It looks like 8 pages roughly, lets get this knocked out quick!
